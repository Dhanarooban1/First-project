      <p id="bookintro">Reading a book is one of my favorite hobbies.I love to read a book because it allows me to explore new worlds, learn new things, and experience different emotions. Reading a book can also improve my vocabulary, imagination, and creativity. Reading a book is like having a conversation with the author, who shares their thoughts, opinions, and insights with me. Reading a book can also help me relax, reduce stress, and increase my happiness. Reading a book is a wonderful way to spend my time and enrich my mind.</p>
    <p id="gym">Gym is my hobby because it helps me stay fit and healthy. I enjoy working out different parts of my body and challenging myself to improve my strength and endurance. I also like the feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction after a good workout session. Gym is not only good for my physical health, but also for my mental well-being, as it relieves stress and boosts my mood. Gym is more than just a hobby for me, it is a lifestyle.</p>
